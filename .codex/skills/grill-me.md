# Grill-Me Skill

You are running the `grill-me` skill for **UI Glitch Hunter**. Your job is to reach a shared design concept before implementation starts.

## When to Use This

Use this skill when:
- The request is ambiguous
- There are multiple reasonable designs
- The work changes module boundaries, terminology, or public interfaces
- The user has a clear goal but the design is still fuzzy

`/feature-start` may invoke this behavior automatically. You can also run it directly when you need a deeper design interrogation.

## Step 1 — Load the Existing Design Context

Before you ask questions, read these files when they exist:
- `.agent-scaffold.json`
- `.agents/context/ubiquitous-language.md`
- `.agents/architecture/module-map.md`
- Any existing `.agents/plans/<feature-slug>.md` for the same feature

If only legacy `.claude/...` planning artifacts exist, read them as migration evidence and write canonical updates under `.agents/`.

Then explore `src` to understand the current implementation shape, similar features, and test boundaries.

## Step 2 — Interview Relentlessly

Ask focused questions until the important design branches are resolved or explicitly parked.

For exploratory prompts, guessing games, or design probes, use the useful part of cold reading without the fraud:
- Make broad, falsifiable reads instead of jumping to one precise answer.
- Offer 2-4 plausible hypotheses when the user's intent is intentionally under-specified.
- Label confidence and uncertainty plainly.
- Ask one small steering question that lets the user correct the frame with minimal effort.
- Treat the user's correction as signal, then narrow the hypothesis.
- Never present inference as evidence.

Good questions are:
- Scope-shaping
- Interface-shaping
- Dependency-shaping
- Risk-shaping
- Constraint-shaping

Do not stop at surface preferences. Walk down each branch of the design tree one dependency at a time.

Examples of the decisions you should force into the open:
- What problem are we solving?
- What is out of scope?
- Which module owns the behavior?
- Which public interface changes?
- What should the user observe when this is done?
- Which feedback loops prove the change works?
- What can be postponed without blocking implementation?

If a decision is truly unresolved, mark it as an explicit open question or parked decision. Do not silently guess.

## Step 3 — Write or Update the Feature Spec

Create or update `.agents/plans/<feature-slug>.md` with:
- Summary
- Goal
- Non-goals
- Constraints
- Canonical terms to use
- Affected modules
- Interface changes
- Acceptance criteria
- Feedback loops
- Open questions / parked decisions

This file is the durable record of the shared design concept. Keep it concise, but do not leave hidden decisions buried in chat history.

## Step 4 — Decide Whether Planning Can Continue

You may hand back to `/feature-start` or the user once:
- The blocking design questions are resolved
- The remaining open questions are explicitly non-blocking
- The feature spec is concrete enough for implementation

If the design is still under-specified, keep grilling. The purpose of this skill is to prevent implementation from starting on vague intent.
